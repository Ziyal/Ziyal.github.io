                <h3 class="standout-text">I'm Sereina, a software developer based in Bothell, WA.</h3>

                <p>After several years selling electronics in the world of retail I jumped into software development and haven’t looked back. Two of my biggest passions are problem solving and creativity. That’s why I feel in love with coding, because it’s a perfect combination of those elements. My goal is to create quality products that are easy for the user to understand and hopefully make their lives a little bit easier.</p>

                <p>In 2017 I completed a 14 week coding bootcamp at Coding Dojo recieving a double black belt. It was a crazy whirlwind time of life where I was able to learn so much and was without a doubt the most challenging thing I've ever done, but it's been so worth it. I'm currently working with Creative Coding, teaching elementary and middle school kids coding fundamentals and helping them make their visions come to life with code.</p>

                <p>Once it's time to step away from my computer for the day there's a few things I might be found doing. Odds are I'll either be dancing lindy hop or thinking about it. It's something that I enjoy immensely! In the rare occasion that I'm <i>not</i> dancing I'm often found watching my latest favorite show, shooting photos with my trusty Canon 6D, baking something gluten-free (likely with chocolate involved), or spending time with my family.</p>

                <p>I wanted to create a project where I could do a lot of pretty front-end stuff with photos, so I created a photogrpahy portfolio using my images. I gained a lot of experience making the whole page responsive, everything from images to the navbar. The back end has upload capabilities and is pulling the album photos from the database.</p>

                <p>After struggling myself for several days learning how to upload files in ASP.NET Core I created a tutorial to help walk others through the process and hopefully simplify it for them. It includes code snippets on the README page and has a working demo to show the end result.</p>

I worked with the front-end team to create a visually appealing design and experience for the user. </p>
